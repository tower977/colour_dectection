This project was undertaken in a bid to try and replicate an online resource I have use in the past to classify colours for  my application build, in an attempt to have a homogenous colour paltte that was aesthetically pleasing.

If for whatever reason I was unable to connect to internet, I would still have the  ability to colour coordinate my palatte on a prototype building proprietary app like justinmind for example. 

opencv, numpy, argparse, and pandas are prerequisites for this example.

A simple pip3 install should do the trick for all these dependencies.
